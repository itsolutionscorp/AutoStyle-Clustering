1. contains1MoreThan returns true correctly when you add a letter to the end of the string.

2. It returns false correctly when there are two different strings. 

3. It never incorrectly returns true. 

4. It incorrectly returned false when we added a letter either at the beginning or somewhere inside of the string. 

5. It crashes if you do not input a string. 

It was wrong because it had "==" instead of "equals()". Strings are objects, not primitive values, so == refers to the reference, which would be false. Equals() checks to see if the actual value is the same.
