in myString is the same as s, then it will return true. 
(It correctly returns true for two strings which have all the same characters but differ in the last index?)

2. When the character in myString is different from the character in s, if everything after that character 
in myString is not the same as s, it will return false. 

3. There are no instances when the function returns True when it is actually false.  

4. In the else statement it compares myString.substring(1) to s to see if they are equal. Since strings are 
objects, it doesn't compare the strings correctly and returns false when it should be true. Instead, we must 
use myString.substring(1).equals(s) to correctly determine if myString.substring(1) and s are equal. 

5. Since strings are objects we can make s null. This would go to the else case and will not be properly evaluated,
so the program will crash
