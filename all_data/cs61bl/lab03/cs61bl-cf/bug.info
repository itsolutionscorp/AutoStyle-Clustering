    Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns true.
    	Pairs of arguments that have exactly a string length difference of 1 and differ by only the character at the very end of myString 
    	correctly return true.  
    
    Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns false.
    	Pairs of arguments that differ by more or less than 1 in string length or do not differ by just the last character in myString 
    	correctly return false. 
    
    Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true, that is, when the first string argument to check is 
    not the result of inserting exactly one character into the second.
    	No pairs of arguments passed to check will incorrectly return true. 
    	
    Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false, that is, when the first string argument to check is 
    the result of inserting exactly one character into the second.
    	Any pair of arguments where the single differing character is at any other position other than the end, contains1MoreThan will incorrectly
    	return false. For example, for the strings "1abc" and "abc", contains1MoreThan will incorrectly return false.  
    
    Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan crashes.
    	We found no pairs of arguments that would cause contains1MoreThan to crash. 
    	
   
   	Explanation of bug:
   		The contains1MoreThan method does not correctly account for single character differences in positions other than at the last position. 
   		We found this bug by systematically testing first whether differing lengths by more than 1 of the strings was being correctly picked up by 
   		the program, and then whether or not the program was picking up on different positions of the differing character. 
   		We found our bug upon testing that second part.
