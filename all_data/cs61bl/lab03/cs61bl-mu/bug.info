1. Only one character differ at the end will return true.
2. Differ one or more character between two strings will 
   always return false(Except both of them are null or either 
   of them is null, and also except only one differ at the end).
3. No pairs of strings. 
4. Only one character differ between two strings but not at the end.
5. Both of them are null, or either of the strings is null.

the content of those two objects.
