1.) Any string pair where all the but the last character of the first string are in the same 
exact order.  The first string will contain one additional character and thus return true correctly.

2.) Any pair of strings with different lengths, different characters, and different orders of
the same characters.

3.) No pairs of strings

4.) When you insert any single character in any position except the last position, then
the check will return false when it should return true.

5.) No pairs of strings.

 
 The 'else if' statement breaks if the characters are not exactly the same in the same order. But it 
 doesn't take into account inserting characters into the middle of a string.
