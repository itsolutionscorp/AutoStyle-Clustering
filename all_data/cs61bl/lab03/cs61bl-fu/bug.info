1. When contains1MoreThan is true:
	- s = "" and myString is any string of length 1.
	- when myString is the result of adding one character to s.
	
2. When contains1MoreThan is false:
	- when both of their (s, myString) first characters are different.
	- when myString is the empty string (or both).
	
3. No pairs return incorrectly true.

4. When contains1MoreThan is incorrectly false:
	- when an additional character is added anywhere in myString except for the end. 
	For example, 'check("abcd", "bcd");' returns false even though they only differ by one character.
	
5. When contains1MoreThan crashes:
	- when either input is the null value.
	
What's wrong: It only returns true correctly if the additional character is added to the end of myString.
If it's inserted within the string, the method does not recognize it and incorrectly returns false. 
We figured this out by testing many different possibilities of string pairs and eventually noticed the bug.
