1. when a character is added at the end or added to an empty string.
2. all pair of strings
3. no pairs of strings
4. insert a character in the middle or in the front
5. when you don't put in strings as the arguments or don't escape some special character such as a single quote or a "\"

We figured it out by tracking the values of myString and s through main for pairs of
strings that would cause the program to fail. The bug is that contains1MoreThan does 
not take into account that a string is an object, not a primitive, so it can't 
be compared using a ==. Instead, we should use a method that compares each char of
the string because those are the primitive components of a string. == should be changed
to .equals(String)
