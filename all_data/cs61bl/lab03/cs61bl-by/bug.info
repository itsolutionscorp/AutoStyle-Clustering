1. contains1MoreThan correctly returns true for any case where you add a character to
the string s after the entirety of the string s. It works 
for any check(string + "x", string) where string is any string, and x is any character.
For example, "abcd" and "abc" works as well as "a" and "".

2. It correctly returns false for any case where the length of the variables do not follow:
length(myString) = length(s) + 1

3. No pairs of strings.

4. The program incorrectly returns false for all true pairs where the added character
is not added after the last character of the original string.

5. All pairs that have null as at least one of the arguments.

Explanation of the Bug
The problem is that the program tries to compare string objects using the == symbol,
but this comparison only checks the references to separate string objects, so it
will always return false when it gets to that comparison. We figured it out because
that was the only line of code that was responding incorrectly when we followed
how the code evaluates each pair of arguments.
