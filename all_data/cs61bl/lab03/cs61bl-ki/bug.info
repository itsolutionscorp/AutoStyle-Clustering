1.Whenever the added character is at the end of MyString, it returns true correctly.
For e.g. ("abcd","abc"). 

2.Whenever the length of MyString doesn't equal to the length of s plus 1, it returns false correctly. 
If the 2 strings are not matched, contains1MoreThan returns false correctly. For all strings that are
 wrong, the program returns false correctly.
For e.g. ("abc","abccd"), ("abc","def")

3. We didn't find any cases for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true. This is probably because
 of the way the program has been written. No pairs of strings.

4. When the first argument has an extra letter inserted at any position
other than the last letter, the program incorrectly returns false. 
For e.g. ("abdc", "abc"), ("dabc","abc").

5. Examples of arguments for which contains1MoreThan crashes 
include the cases where non-string arguments are entered. It also crashes 
if one of the arguments is a null String.
E.g. ("abc", 3), ("abc", "")
