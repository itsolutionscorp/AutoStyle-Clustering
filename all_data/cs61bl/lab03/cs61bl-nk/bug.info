1. This program correctly returns true when string s
is just an additional letter inserted to myString.

2. This program correctly returns false when the length of myString
and string s are the same, so no new letters are inserted.
Even if there are letters in s that are replaced, this program
returns false correctly. 

3. No pairs of strings give an incorrect true. 

4. The program incorrectly returns false when you insert exactly one 
letter into anywhere inside myString except the end.

5. No pairs of strings will cause it to crash. 
It will crash when arguments other than strings are passed into the argument. 


The last else case in the contains1MoreThan method doesn't check the value of the
string inputs. It just checks to see if they are the same thing. 
This is why when you input myString as abc and string s as abcd, it will incorrectly return a false,
when in fact it is true that you just inserted an extra letter to abc. 

We figured this out with repeated calls to check, and then going through the method
ourselves with each input.
