1. contains1MoreThan correctly returns true when s is an empty string and myString is only one character long. It also works when myString is the same as s except for an additional character at the very end.
2. contains1MoreThan correctly returns false when myString is an empty string.
3. contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true for no pairs of strings
4.contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false when myString is the same as s except for an additional character that exists anywhere but at the end.
5. contains1MoreThan crashes when myString = null, s = null, or both myString and s are equal to null. 



Bug: the last else clause uses the == operator instead of the .equals() method (it compares for reference equality instead of value equality).

We figured it out by first noting that strings should never be compared using the == operator, so when we saw that in the code, we flagged it in our minds.
