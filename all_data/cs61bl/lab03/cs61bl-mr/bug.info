1. The inserted letter is located at the end of the string.
2. It correctly returns false if more than one letter are added; if no letter is added; if the 
letters in myString do not contain the same letters with the same order of the letters in String s.
3. No pair of strings.
4. The inserted letter is located in the beginning or in the middle of the string.
5. As long as an user puts strings into the method as parameters, it is not going to crash.

The bug exists in the line "return myString.substring(1) == s;". While the content of 
myString.substring(1) may be the same as s, "==" will only compare the reference of these two
reference variables rather than the content of the objects. myString.substring(1) and s are pointing
to different objects; therefore, this line will always return false whether myString.substring(1) and
s are actually the same or not. We called check on the pair "2a" and "a", and the pair "a2b" and "ab".
These two pairs should all return true, while the program returned false for both of them. We conclude
that the bug will cause the program to return false incorrectly when the inserted letter is in the
beginning or in the middle of a string. In these two cases, the line that actually returns the result
is the line "return myString.substring(1) == s;", because these two cases do not satisfy the condition
"myString.length() == 0" or "s.length() == 0". Hence, we determined that the bug is in the line "return
 myString.substring(1) == s;".
