1. All pairs of arguments for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns true
	All pairs where both strings are the same, but one has exactly one more character at the end (just the end).
2. All pairs of arguments for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns false
	All pairs where one string needs to do more than just adding a character to become exactly the other string (extra actions may include scrambling then adding, like "abc" to "acbd").
3. All pairs of arguments for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true
	No pairs of string.
4. All pairs of arguments for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false
	All pairs where the single added character is added anywhere besides the end (for example, "dabc" and "abc" should return true, but it returns false).
5. All pairs for which contains1MoreThan crashes
	All pairs where one or both of arguments are not String type.
	
The contains1MoreThan method iterates through both string by individual character, but it can't detect if the added character is added anywhere besides the end.
It can only detect added character if it's added at the end.
We figured this out by changing the position of the added character, and find that the position matters.
Moreover, we found that the function behaves as it should be, returning false for all cases where it should be returning false.
