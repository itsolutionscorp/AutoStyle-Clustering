1. When one of the string has one more character than the other string.
2. When one of the string does not have one more character than the other string.
3. None pairs of strings.
4. When one of the string has one more character, but that extra character is not at the end.
5. None pairs of strings.

Explanation of the bug
The operator == only compare the reference to the strings char. So we need to use the function equals() when comparing 2 strings to see if they have the same number of strings.
We figured it out by realizing that string is an array of characters. So it is referred to by a pointer.
