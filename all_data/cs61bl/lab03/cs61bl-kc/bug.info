1. contains1MoreThan returns true when a character is inserted to an empty string.

2. contains1MoreThan returns false when more than one character is inserted, or if one or more characters in myString are different from argument s.

3. no strings.

4. contains1MoreThan returns false instead of true when a character is inserted anywhere except the end of argument s.

5. no strings.

Bug: Line 21 should be changed to myString.substring(1).equals(s) because strings cannot be directly compared with "==".
