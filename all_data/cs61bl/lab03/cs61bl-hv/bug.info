1. When s and myString differ by one character, and that character is at the very end of the String.
2. contains1MoreThan correctly returns false for all original cases where it should return false. This is because == will return false whenever .equals(str2) returns false.
3. It never incorrectly returns true. 
4. Whenever s and myString differ by one character, and that character in NOT at the end of the String (somewhere in the middle).
5. Never crashes.

Explanation:
return myString == s;
   should be
return myString.substring(1).equals(s);

	The bug was found by reading through the code and noticing that String comparison was done with == instead of .equals(str2)
