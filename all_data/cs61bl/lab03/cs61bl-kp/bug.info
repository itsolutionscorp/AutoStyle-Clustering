1. correctly returns true when the addition is at the end of the first string

2. correctly returns false when the first string is not the result of adding one character to the second string

3. never incorrectly returns true

4. incorrectly returns false when the added character is not at the end of the first string

5. never crashes

Explanation:

The last else clause of contains1MoreThan will always return false, because the references myString.substring(1) and s will always point to different string objects, and '==' checks whether two references point to the same object.
