We found the following bug:

The comparison checks if each letter is the same position in the 2 strings

1. if the extra letter is inserted at the end, then check works as desired.
Also, if s is empty and myString has 1 character, then it works.

2. if myString is empty, then it correctly returns false.

3. no pairs of strings

4. It incorrectly returns false when the new character in myString is not inserted at the end of s.

5.
