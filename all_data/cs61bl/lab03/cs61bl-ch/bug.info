1. -When the length of the first string is 1 and the length of the second string is 0. 
2. -When the length of the first string is 0. 
3. - no pairs of strings
4. -When the first string is the second string with one character added to the front of it.
-When the first string is the second string with one character added in the middle of it
5. - If the arguments given are not strings 

Explanation:
The problem is that == checks whether the two strings point to the same object (this is incorrect when you are trying to check when myString.substring(1) == s). We aren't trying to check whether they point to the same object, only that the characters are the same. This is what causes the error in the recursion.
