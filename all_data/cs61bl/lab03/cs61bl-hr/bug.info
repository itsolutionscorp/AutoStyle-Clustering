1. Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns true.
Both of the strings are one letter long.
One of the strings is a one character addition to the back of the other. 
2. Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns false.
One string is the other with an addition in the back. 
Both strings are the same length with more than one change. 
3. Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true, 
that is, when the first string argument to check is not the result of inserting exactly one character 
into the second.
The second string is a one character addition to the first string. 
4. Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false,
 that is, when the first string argument to check is the result of inserting exactly one character 
 into the second.
 One string has an addition in the front. 
 One string has an insertion to the other string. 
5. Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan crashes.
If given non-strings. 

Explanation of the bug:
The program doesn't work when a string has an addition to it in the front, or when the addition
is to the middle or not-ends of the string.
