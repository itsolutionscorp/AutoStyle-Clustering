1. Any strings that are equal except for an additional character at the end
of the first string.
2. Strings that are the same length. Strings that have more than one
extra character. Strings that share basically no resemblance.
3. We found none.
4.Strings in which the added character appears in the first or in the middle
of the word. So basically any true pair with the extra character not on the
end.
5.We found none.

The Bug: The code only responds correctly if the added words is at the end. The 
code ideally should be able to detect characters added at any position in
the string.
