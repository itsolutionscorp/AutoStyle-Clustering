1. contains1MoreThan will correctly return true in the case that
the first string contains one extra character than the second string
at the end. (Ex., "abcd" and "abc")

2. contains1MoreThan will correctly return false in the case that
the first string contains either:
- more than one extra character than the second string (Ex., "abcde" and "abc")
- different characters than the second string, no matter what length (Ex., "abcd" and "dfg")
- the same or less characters than the second string (Ex., "1" and "12")

3. contains1MoreThan will incorrectly return true for no pairs of strings.

4. contains1MoreThan will incorrectly return false in the case that
the first string contains one extra character than the second string
at any point in the string. (Ex., "abc" and "bc")

5. contains1MoreThan will crash in the case that the two arguments
passed in are not of the String type.

The contains1MoreThan method is buggy on the line:
	return myString.substring(1) == s;
This line checks if the rest of the first string points
to the same string (object) as the second string, not for
the same values inside the strings.
