We think the bug is that the contains1MoreThan method cannot check the situation that on characater is inserted among them. Only if at the beginning or end can be correctly true.
When it went for a different character in s1 and s2, shouldn't it be false right away, it should also check the next string, if the next string are same, it should be true.
