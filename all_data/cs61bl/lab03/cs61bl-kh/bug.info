1. If the extra character is at the end of myString, the method will return True correctly.
2. It correctly returns false for strings of the same length, if there is more than one difference in strings of different lengths. 
3. We did not find any pairs of arguments for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true. 
4. contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false when there is one difference but the difference is not at the end. 
5. No pairs of strings cause contains1MoreThan to crash.

The bug is that the string comparisons done with == only checks if the references refer to the same object. The String method .equals should be used in this case instead
of ==. We figured it out by checking "2abc" and "abc", because this goes into the last else case that contains the incorrect comparison.
