1. 1) when s is added at the end of myString, check returns true  
   check("abc2", "abc") --> is true and returns true
   check("iii1", "iii") --> is true and returns true
   even when I reference String object into a variable and pass it in, 
   s added to end of myString works
   
   2) when s is "",and myString is a single character
   check(" ","");
   check("a","");
   check("1","");
   check("@","");
   
2. 1) when myString ==""(except s being null).	
   
   check("", " ");
   check("", "");	
   check("","1");
   check("","a");
   check("","@");
   check("","abc");

   2) when s is "",but myString is more than a letter.
   
   check("  ","");
   check("ab","");
   check("12","");
   
3.I could not find one.
   
4. When s is added to the front or in the middle, JVM returns incorrectly returns false.
   1abc, abc --> is true but returns false
   a1bc, abc --> is true but returns false 
   
5. when you pass null as an argument for check method, the system crashes.

   check("12",null);
   check(null,"");
   check(null,null);
   
And yes,I made all these tests for AccountTester and Debug to get used to Java interface a little more.
