Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns true.
	some of the possible inputs that will return true are:
		"abcd" "abc"
		"ab" "a"
		"what" "wha"
		"lynda" "lynd"

Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan correctly returns false.
	some of the possible inputs that will return false are:
		"abc" "dxc"
		"123" "nope"
		"who" "how"
		"lynda" "ynda"


Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns true, 
that is, when the first string argument to check is not the result of inserting exactly one character into the second.
	“aba”  “aba”
	“def”  “fed”
	“sos” “sos” 
	“pencil” “licnep”

Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false,
that is, when the first string argument to check is the result of inserting exactly one character into the second.
	When the original list is blank it returns false. When you add something to nothing, even when its adding 
	exactly one character, it will return false
	“irc” “circle”
	“hon” “phone” 
 	“ove” “love”
 	
Describe all pairs of arguments to check for which contains1MoreThan crashes.
	“def” “check” “book”
	“lynda” “alara” “pencil”
 	
 	If we looked at our code and check for what is wrong with it we can use the debug 
	we can see this results,

		1) The return type of our code is string but we are returning the contains1morethan is a 
		boolean function. Our function and return type have to be same type.
		2) Also it is a boolean function but it takes a string parameter
		3) An other point is that, our check method is void type which means that it should not 
		be return anything but when we are calling the function in returns something; it 
		should not.
