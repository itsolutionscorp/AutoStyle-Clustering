\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. The method correctly returns true if the one additional character in myString is at the end of the string. (In other words, all but the last character of myString would be equal to the characters in s.) \
2. The method correctly returns false if myString is an empty string or if myString and s are the same. Additionally, it will also correctly return false if myString and s are completely different. \
3. There are no pairs of strings for which the method incorrectly returns true;\
4. The method incorrectly returns false when the one additional character is anywhere other than at the end of the string. For example, if the character is inserted in the middle of the string, the function should output true, but it outputs false instead. \
5. There are no pairs of strings for which the method crashes.  \
\
The problem with this method is that it doesn\'92t account for the additional character being inserted anywhere other than at the end of the string. We figured this out by testing two strings that were identical, except that one of them had one additional character inserted in the middle of the string rather than at the end. This returned false, even though it should have returned true.}
