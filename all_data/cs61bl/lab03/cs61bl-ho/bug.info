1. Corretcly returns true: when finally (s.length()==0)&&(myString.length() == 1)
   e.g. check("abc2", "abc"), check("a","")

2. Corretcly returns false: when 1. myString.length()==0 or
                                 2. (s.length()==0)&&(myString.length() != 1) or
                                 3. It is false due to some reasons but the program regards it as false according to other reasons.
   e.g. 1. check("","");
        2. check("ab","");
        3. check("abc", "def"); // It is false beacause the sentence "bc" is not "def", however, the program regards it as false because they refer to different objects.

3. incorrectly returns true: no pairs of strings

4. incorrectly returns false: beacuse String refers to an object, when applying "==", we campare the object rather than the exact content.
   e.g. check("2abc", "abc"), check("a2bc", "abc"), check("ab2c", "abc"); 

5. crashes: the number of characters in the String exceeds its capacity
