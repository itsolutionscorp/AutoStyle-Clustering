1. Pairs that should correctly return true should have the first argument 
the same as the second with the exception of one additional character in 
any spot within the String.

2. Pairs that should not correctly return true either do not have the same
String at all, or have more than one additional character in any spot. The
length could also differ by greater than one.

3. There are no pairs where contains1MoreThan will incorrectly return true.

4. contains1Morethan returns false incorrectly when the character is anywhere
but at the end of String s.

5. There were no pairs we used that crashed the function.

What was wrong:
The function was trying to compare two strings using '==' but that only checks
if they reference the same data (which is why it works for primitive data like
numbers). By changing it to use the equals() method it worked.
