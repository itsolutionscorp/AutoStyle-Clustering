1) one character strings that are the same character like myString="a" with 
   s = "", strings that differ by one character at the end like
    myString = "javas" paired with  s = "java".
2) strings with lengths of 0, like myString = "" with s = "", strings that do not
   contain common characters like myString= "abc" with s ="def", strings that differ
   by more than one character like myString = "javssa" and s = "java", strings like
   myString = "" with s ="d". 
3) No pair of strings. 
4) Strings where the extra character is in the middle or beginning of the string, like 
  my String = "javsa" paired with  s = "java" or myString ="sjava" with s ="java".
5) Crashes when the arguments are not of type string, like integer arguments. Or, if
   the arguments are of type null.
  
6) The error with the contains1MoreThan method is that the base case
   uses == to test for string equality. However, because strings are objects
   the equals method must be used to test equality. I figured it out by remembering
   that == only compares references, not the actual equality of the objects.
