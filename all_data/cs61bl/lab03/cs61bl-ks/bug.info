1. Returns true for when a string is inserted at the end (abc -> abc2).

2. When the strings are same length, when more than one is inserted, when characters are rearranged.

3. No such case founded.

4. Incorrectly returns false when the single added letter is placed somewhere other than the end of the string. 

5. All the pairs that described above. We must test if the test gives us false with the cases described in quesiton 2 and
	also we need to check if when the letter is added anywhere in myString. 

Explanation of the Bug:
	Since strings act as object in java, we should have used string method to check if myString.substring(1) is equal to s.
	In original code, we had myString.substring(1) == s , which gave us an error. 
	Instead, using string method, myString.substring(1).equals(s) lets us what we exactly want to do.
