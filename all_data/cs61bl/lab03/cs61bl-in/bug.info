1. Returns true when myString is the same as s2, but has one extra character at the end.
2. Returns false when myString is not the same and does not have an extra character at the end.
3. No pair of strings causes an incorrect true return.
4. Returns false incorrectly when myString and s2 are the same but a character is added before or in between myString.
5. Crashes when the input is of the wrong type (not a string) or null.

Explanation:
The debug program truncates every character of myString that is the same as the corresponding letter of s2, using recursive calls.
However it does not take into account if an extra character is added before or in between myString. My last two checks show this.
I could not find a way to cause the program to incorrectly return true.
