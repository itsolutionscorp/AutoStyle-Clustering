
1. For all pairs of arguments in which one argument has one more character
at the end - not counting spaces - the program correctly returns true.

2. When there is more than one character, the program correctly returns false.

3. No pairs of strings will cause the program to incorrectly return true.

4. When one correct character is added to the beginning of an argument, or if
a space character is added at the end, the program incorrectly returns false.

5. No pairs of strings will cause the program to crash.

EXPLANATION: The bug occurs when we compare the substring to the rest of the other string
using a comparison (==) instead of .equals(); as a result, even if both arguments have the
same string value, they are not considered the same. We discovered the bug when we added
one character to the beginning of the first argument. As a result, the first argument was not
correctly compared to the second one.
