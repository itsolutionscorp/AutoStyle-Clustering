1. All pairs of strings where one string has the original letters of the other string together and then the 1 extra character at the end.

2. All pairs that have more than or less than 1 extra character.

3. No pairs.

4. All pairs of strings where one string has the original letters of the other string but the 1 extra character is not at the end. (it could be in the front or somewhere in the middle)

5. No pairs.

What is wrong with the method is that it was comparing strings with the "==" operator instead of equals. The == operator just sees if the two strings are the exact same copy. I figured it out by using a debugger and seeing that the == operator returned false even though the two strings contained the same characters.
