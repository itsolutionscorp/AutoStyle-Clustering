1. Before modifying the contains1MoreThan method, the method only returns true when the different character is inserted at
   the end of string.
contains1MoreThan should return true when the one character difference between strings is at the beginning of the string,
   at the end, or in the middle. So the arguments I used to check contains1MoreThan were check("2abc", "abc") for the 
   beginning of the string, check("abc", "abc2") for the end of the string, and check("nancy2chang", "nancychang") for the 
   middle of the string. Also, if a string that has no characters is being compared to a string with one character, it should
   return true. 

2. contains1MoreThan should return false when there is more than one character difference between strings when they are
   consecutive and when they are not. So the arguments I used to check contains1MoreThan were check("nancychang", "nancydrew")
   for when more than one character differences were consecutive and check("nancy", "n1an3cy") for when more than one 
   character differences were not consecutive. Also, if a string that has no characters is being compared to a string with
   more than one character, it should return false. 
   
3. Before modifying the contains1MoreThan method, there were no pairs of strings that incorrectly returned true.
   
4. Before modifying the contains1MoreThan method, it incorrectly returned false when inserting one character within 
   and at the beginning of the input.

5. Before modifying the contains1MoreThan method, it crashed when there was a NullPointerException.

The bug that was in the contains1MoreThan method was that == is different than equals(). == checks if the variables refer
to the same object whereas equals() checks if the object contains the same contents.
