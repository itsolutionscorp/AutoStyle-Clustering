1. every single time you exactly 1 additional char into the end of the string 
2. every single time you add anything but 1 additional char into the end of the string OR take away chars from the string 
3. No pair of strings 
4. every single time you add exactly 1 additional char to the beginning of the string OR in the middle of the string 
5. crashes when you use (null, null) as its parameters 

details of the bug: 
program only checks at the end of the string; and gives us incorrect results if there was exactly one addition to the front or the middle. 
We discovered this by just running tests checking additions in the front, middle, and the end of the string.
