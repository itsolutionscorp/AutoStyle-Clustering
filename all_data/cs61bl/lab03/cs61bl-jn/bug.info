1. When the first argument is the second argument and has an extra character added at the end (e.g. "asdf2", "asdf")
2. all pairs of strings
3. When the inserted character is not at the end (ie. in the beginning or somewhere in the middle) (e.g."2asdf", "asdf")
4. no pairs of strings
5. When the argument is not a string

The problem with the contains1MoreThan is that the final else case improperly compares the myString.substring(1) to s. Since strings are objects, == sees if it points to the same things, rather than if the contents are equal. Properly, to fix the bug, the code should be changed to myString.substring(1).equals(s).
We figured out this code because I have experience with java and noticed that you can't compare strings with ==.
