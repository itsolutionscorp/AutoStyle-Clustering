The method contains1MoreThan correctly returns true when the first
argument is any one character and the second argument is an empty
string. It also correctly returns true when the first argument holds
the exact same string as the second argument, plus one more additional
character at the very end. The method will also correctly return true
when one or both of the arguments are variables pointing to strings that
satisfy the condition.

Contains1MoreThan correctly returns false when there is no difference
between the first and second arguments, as well as when there may be
differences in the exact characters contained in the two arguments, but
the number of characters is the same. The method will also correctly
return false when one or both of the arguments are variables pointing to
strings that satisfy the condition.

I was not able to find any cases in which contains1MoreThan returned true
incorrectly.

However, contains1MoreThan incorrectly returns false when a single
character is inserted into the the middle of a first argument string that
is otherwise identical to the second argument. For example, the pair of
strings "abcd" and "abd" would return a false, although the condition is
satisfied in that exactly one character, "c," was inserted into the string
"abd."

I was not able to find any cases that caused contains1MoreThan to crash.
However, it should be noted that contains1MoreThan's arguments must be
strings or variables that point to strings, or it will not run.

I believe the reason behind the cases leading to incorrect false returns
is in the second else if case of the code. Provided that neither string s
nor myString are empty, contains1MoreThan proceeds to check the characters
of each string against each other, in order. It compares the first of
the characters of the strings, and then moves on to the second, and so on
until it encounters a pair of characters that do not match up, or until
either myString or string s are empty. Because it checks the characters in
order, as soon as a pair of characters to not equate, it returns false.
This ignores the possibility that the rest of the myString is identical to
the rest of string s, save for one additional character inserted into the
middle, or the beginning.
