\f0\fs24 \cf0 1) It correctly returns true if the first argument is a result of adding one character to the end of the second argument.\
2) It correctly returns false if the first argument is not the result of adding one character to second argument.\
3) No pair of strings will return a false positive.\
4) It incorrectly returns false when the one character added is not added to the end of the second argument.\
5) It crashes when one of the arguments is null and the other is a nonempty string.\

We figured this out by testing various pairs of arguments with check. The bug is that strings are objects and so in order to compare them you have to use the .equal() method rather than ==. Using == checks if they\'92re point to the same thing while .equal() checks if what they are pointing to are the same thing.}
