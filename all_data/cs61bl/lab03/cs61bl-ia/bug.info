1. When s1 is of length = 1, and s2 is of length = 0, it works correctly. Or, when s1 is s2 with a single character appended to it.

2. Any pairs of strings where s1 is not one character added to s2 (any pair of strings that should return false) will correctly return false.

3. There is no pair that will produce a false positive.

4. If the appended character does not appear last in s1.

5. If s1, s2 or both are null, the program will crash.


In the final else clause of contains1MoreThan, there is a comparison of Strings using "==". Because Strings are objects, this does not correctly test equality. String.equals() should be used instead.
