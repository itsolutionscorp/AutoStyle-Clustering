1. only for pairs where only one character is added to the END of the string

2. (1) when the length of myString is more than 1 character different from s (2) when both strings have the same length (3) when myString is null (4) when there is more than one character is different in my String

3. No Pairs of strings

4. (1) when one character is added to the beginning (2) when one character is added in the middle

5.No pairs of strings

the last else statement is implemented incorrectly. by running the code by hand we saw why the code only worked when a character was added in the and (by checking that the length is 0), and realized that the bug was by not comparing it to the rest of s.
