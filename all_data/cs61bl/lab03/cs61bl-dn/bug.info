1. All arguments where:
	a. myString.len = s.len + 1
	b. myString = s + "?" [i.e. the character must be added to the back of s]

2. All arguments where:
	a. myString.len != s.len + 1
	b. Adding a character to the END of s wouldn't make it equivalent to myString.

3. No pairs of strings.

4. All arguments where
	a. adding a character to somewhere other than the end of s would result in myString.

5. No pairs of strings.


THE BUG
-------
The bug was in the last clause. We were checking the equality between two strings, when we
should have been using the String.equals method, since strings are objects and == isn't the right
tool for the job. == should be used for primitives and for checking if two references point to the exact
same object.
