1. contains1MoreThan only correctly returns true when the extra character
is at the end of the string.

2. It correctly returns false if the difference in length between myString
and the input string s is not equal to 1, even if all of the other
characters match up. 

3. It incorrectly returns true for no pairs of strings.

4. It incorrectly returns false if the extra character is at the beginning
or middle of the string because in the last else statement of contains1MoreThan,
myString.substring(1) and s are referencing two different string objects
and will return false even if the strings look the same, since == checks if the two
things on either side are referencing the same object.

5. It crashes for no pairs of strings but will crash if the type that is inputted
is not correct.
