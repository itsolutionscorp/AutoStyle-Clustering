1)All the pairs in the following method that correctly return "true" make use of the same
letters in the same order, despite the additional character added 
throughout the sequence of said letters. 
2)Reasons that an argument would return false include: strings that vary in 
length by more than one character, strings that differ in alphabet composition
, or if myString is zero in length.
3) There were no arguments found that incorrectly returns true. 
4)The method returns false when a new character is added anywhere other 
than the end of the string, despite the fact that it should return true whenever
one character is added to the string, regardless of the order.  
5) There were no arguments found that result in a crash. 

Explanation of the Bug:
- The following method does not properly test various cases that have an additional
character placed somewhere in the string other than the end, despite the fact 
they do in fact only have one additional character. While the method should return
true, it returns false for multiple cases similar to the one listed above.
