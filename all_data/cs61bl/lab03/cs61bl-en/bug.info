1.  - Check to see if adding anything to a null string returns true.
    - Check to see if adding a character anywhere in myString returns true.
    - Check for capital letters (all should be the same)
         
2.  - Check to see if adding 1 character to a "null" string with a space in
      it returns false.
    - Check to see if aside from adding 1 character, one or more of the
      original characters were changed.
    - Check to see if adding more than 1 character returns false.
    - Check for capital letters (if any different, false)

3.  - No pairs of strings (I'm assuming we're going off of my altered
          contains1MoreThan, not the original one given to us)
    
4.  - No pairs of strings (I'm assuming we're going off of my altered
          contains1MoreThan, not the original one given to us)

5.  - check(null, null); creates an error. 
    - Possibly anything that is too long.


The original contains1MoreThan would only return true if a character was added at 
the end. I modiffied the else case when it checks to see if the first characters 
of the pair are the same. I created a remainder of myString withouth the first character, 
then added in the first character at the end (since it checks to see if myString.length() == 1 
when s.length == 0), and recursively checked the rest of it with s.
