1. We implemented the single loop method.
2. There would two loops; the inner loop would handle the inputs between each sutobtal, and the outer loop would print out the actual subtotal and total.  
3. I like our version better because: 
	1. The run-time would probably be faster since there's only one loop
	2. It's simpler to read and understand, and making your code understandable is one of the most important parts of coding.
