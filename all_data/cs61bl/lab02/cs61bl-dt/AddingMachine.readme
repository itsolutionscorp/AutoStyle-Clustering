1. We used the single while loop version. 
2. The double while loop version be
	while true:
		while justStarting is equal to true
			if input is 0 then terminate this loop and return subtotal
			else add input to subtotal and total
			
		print total 
		
3. We prefer the single loop version because it is faster to process and it is easier to debug
	the double loop version is easier to visualize and easier to manipulate.
