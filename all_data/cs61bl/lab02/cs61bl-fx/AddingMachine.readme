1. Which version did you implement for the exercise?
	A single while-loop

2.Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
	A while loop that always runs and another loop that check zeros.

3.Which version do you prefer? Describe two reasons for preferring the one-loop version and two reasons for preferring the two-loop version.
	I prefer a single while-loop, because it is easier to think.
while the two-loop version is more effective and shorter in coding.
