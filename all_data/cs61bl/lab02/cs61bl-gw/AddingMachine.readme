1) Which version did you implement for the exercise?
The first version which is single loop
2) Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
So the other version which is two-loop: the inner loop will store the subtotal and the outer loop will store the total. Thus everytime the input value = 0 then it goes to the outer loop.
3) Which version do you prefer? Describe two reasons for preferring the one-loop version and two reasons for preferring the two-loop version.
I prefer one-loop version because it is more efficient way to solve the problem and single-loop prevents the nest blocks structure too deeply
the two-loop version will be prefered because it is more structural and the if statement is more simple and easy to understand.
