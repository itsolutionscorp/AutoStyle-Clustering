1. We implemented the single while loop, which contained nested if-else statements.

2. The outer loop would return the total, while the inner loop would return the subtotal.

3. One-loop version:
	1). One less loop to worry about coding
	2). Might be tedious to use nested if-else, but it isn't as 		confusing to code
   Two-loop version:
	1). Less risk of syntax errors
	2). Not as tedious to code
