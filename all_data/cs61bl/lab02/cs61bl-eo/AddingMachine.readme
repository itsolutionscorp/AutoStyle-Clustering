For the exercise, we implemented the version with only the given while loop. 
The other version would have an inner and outer (given) while loop. 
	The inner while loop would terminate when the input is 0.
	The outer while loop (and thus the program) would terminate when the input is the consecutive 0.
	If the input is not a consecutive 0, the outer while loop and thus the inner loop would run again.
	We would use justStarting as the conditional statement for the inner while loop and set it to false if the input is 0.
We'd prefer the version with two while loops because the code would be more concise and organized.
	The two while loops would be more efficient if there are more nonzero inputs than zero inputs. 
The version with a single loop is more straightforward. 
	In the case that many 0s are inputed but not consecutive, the one while loop would be more efficient.
