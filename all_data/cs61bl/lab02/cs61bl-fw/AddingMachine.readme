1. We use single loop version. 

2. the idea of double loop version:
   calculate each subtotal by inner loop
   calculate each total in outer loop and to a variable to decide if there is a consecutive 0
   
3. single loop: straightforward to write code and spend less running time
   double loop: the structure is clearer than single loop, it will make the code shorter.
