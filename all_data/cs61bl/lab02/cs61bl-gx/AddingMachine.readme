Which version did you implement for the exercise?
We used a single loop to create the adding machine.
Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
The second loop would activate once a subtotal was returned and check for a following 0. If there was no following 0 then it would exit the second loop and return back to the first loop, in essence setting the justStarting variable to true again.
Which version do you prefer?
It is cleaner and simpler, uses a boolean in place of an unwieldy while loop. The two-loop version may be more logical to code for some, while the one-loop version is more elegant and easier to debug.
