\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. We implemented the single loop method for the exercise.\
2. The double loop method would use an inside loop in order to track whether a 0 is inputed. If a second 0 is inputed then it would exit the loop into the outer loop and simply print the overall total and return.\
3. The one loop method is much easier conceptually because it doesn\'92t have a loop within a loop. It is also cleaner looking. The double loop method separates the two 0 scenarios and thus might make the code more efficient. Furthermore, although conceptually harder, the double loop method would be easier to code.}
