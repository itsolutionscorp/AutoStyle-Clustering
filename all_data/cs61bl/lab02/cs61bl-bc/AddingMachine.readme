1) We implemented the single-loop version.
2) The outer loop would wait for the first 0, and the inner loop would wait for the second 0.
3) We obviously prefer the first version. The overhead of simply keeping track of a "prev" variable is less than the overhead of dealing with another loop. Additionally, it was more intuitive for us and was the first thing that popped into our heads.
