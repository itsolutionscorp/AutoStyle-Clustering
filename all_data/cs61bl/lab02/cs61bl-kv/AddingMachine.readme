We used a single loop to implement the adding machine. It seemed intuitive to simply use if statements for the limited possible inputs.

The version using two loops would have subtotal as its own loop within a continuously running total loop. Both loops break when they receive a zero input.

The single loop version is simpler and usually more efficient than a double while loop.

The double loop is more organized and may require less code depending on the implementation.
