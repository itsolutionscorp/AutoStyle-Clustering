1. We implemented a version with one loop and two conditionals within the loop.

2. You could keep track of two variables while trying to find out when they both equal 0 to break the loop.

3. Our version! 
One-loop: easier to keep track of one loop and (probably) takes less memory.
Two-loop: less conditionals means less code complexity and it is more clear when the loop breaks.
