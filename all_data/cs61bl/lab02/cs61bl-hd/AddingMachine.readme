-Single loop
-Two loops version works by having while loop that adds n to subtotal if n!=0,
and escapes the loop if n==0 and print subtotal and resets subtotal to 0 outside the loop.

- We prefer two-loop version.
- Single-loop version is easy to code at the first time, and we can find where the bug is more easily.
- Two-loop version would be easier to understand, and it is better in composition.
