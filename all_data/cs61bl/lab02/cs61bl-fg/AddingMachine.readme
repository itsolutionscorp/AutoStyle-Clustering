We use the single loop to solve this problem.

other version is like a loop inside a loop.
The inside loop will only get executed when the k =0 is met.
It is like the loop a second chance to run.
Use the justStarting as a flag to indicate the k.
if the k after the first time when k= 0  is not 0, we would turn the justStarting back to true in the second loop.

I would prefer the single loop and using && to combine situations.
It looks concise.
