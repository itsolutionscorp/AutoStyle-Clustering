Which version did you implement for the exercise?
We used a single loop.

The other version would have a while loop condition while k != 0 and have it update the subtotal and previous k

We prefer the one loop 
The one loop:
looks cleaner
seems more efficient

The two loops:
would be easier to understand when reading the code
might be easier to catch bugs in your own code
