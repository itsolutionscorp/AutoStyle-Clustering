1) I implemented the version with 2 while loops

2) In the other version I'd keep track of the case of 2 consecutive
zeroes with a boolean variable called DoubleZero, and split the three-cases
with conditionals (non-zero value, zero but DoubleZero false, and zero but DoubleZero true)

3) I prefer the single while loop because it seems more efficient and seems more readable.
The double while-loop has the advantage of being a more intuitive approach, and its easier to think of.
