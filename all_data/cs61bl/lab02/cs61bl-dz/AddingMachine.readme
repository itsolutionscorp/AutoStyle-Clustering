1. We implemented the one-loop
2. The two-loop version would work using a second loop within a larger loop that
calculates the subtotal between 0's. The larger loop would take the subtotals from
each segment and add it to the total.
3. We preferred the one-loop, because it was more intuitive and we found it easier to follow
along with. The two-loop potentially uses less conditional clauses and as a result the code
could potentially be shorter.
