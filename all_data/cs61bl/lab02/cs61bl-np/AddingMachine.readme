For the adding machine we used the single while loop process.

To use the double while loop, both loops would stop when 0 is the input, so the outside loop would end if it was 0, or continue the inner while loop if the input was an integer again.

Single loop:
-easier to understand
-easier to edit/implement

double loop:
-physically shorter
-more efficient
