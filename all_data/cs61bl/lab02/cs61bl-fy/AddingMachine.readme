Which version did you implement for the exercise?
	We implemented the version that only had one while loop.
Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
	The other version would have another while loop within the first while loop to keep track of the subtotal. 
Which version do you prefer? Describe two reasons for preferring the one-loop version and two reasons for preferring the two-loop version.
	I used the one-loop version because I thought it was simpler to just have if statements within the while loop as conditionals for executing instead of having the code cycle through another while loop.
