1. No inner loop was used for this assignment;
2. The other way would have another while loop inside
and inside that would be while the input isnt 0 add to the subtotal;
3. the one loop only needs one conditional, also it is easier to follow.
the two loop makes the code simpler and also allows a better display to be made.
