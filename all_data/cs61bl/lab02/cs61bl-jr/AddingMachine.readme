I implemented the version of the Adding Machine involving one while loop rather than the nested while loop code.
The version involving the nested while loop would have subtotal inside the nested while loop and the total within
the first while loop, and update the total when the nested while loop ends. I prefer the code with one while
loop because it is more simple to follow. Two reasons for preferring the one-loop version would be simpler and
less susceptible for an infinite loop. On the other hand, two while loops would be beneficial because you could
use less variables and involves simpler, more readable code.
