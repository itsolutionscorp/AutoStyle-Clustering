We implemented a single loop for the addingmachine.

To implement a version with two loops, the inner while loop can check if the user input was not "0". 
If it was zero, then the program would check whether to print subtotal or total.

The two loop version may have less code, and might not require nested if statements.
The extra while loop adds another potential source for error.
The single loop version might have better readability.
