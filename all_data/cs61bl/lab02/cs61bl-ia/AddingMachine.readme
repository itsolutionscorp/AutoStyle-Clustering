We implemented the one loop version of the AddingMachine. 

A two loop version would include one while loop for values of k that are not 0, which only exits when the next inputted value is 0. The outer while loop handles the cases where k is 0. 

Benefits of one loop: 
-More direct
-Less Runtime

Benefits of two loops:
-Easier to read
-More organized
