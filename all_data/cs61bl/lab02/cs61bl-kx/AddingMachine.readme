Which version did you implement for the exercise?
We implemented a single while loop.

Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
There would be another while loop where the loop exists when two zeroes are inputted consecutively.

Which version do you prefer? Describe two reasons for preferring the one-loop version and two reasons for preferring the two-loop version.
We prefer the single loop because it uses an instance variable which allows for a more efficient runtime compared to having to run through another loop every time the program is run.
