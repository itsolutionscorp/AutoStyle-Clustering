1. We used one loop, with multiple conditional (if..else) statements
2. by changing the conditional statement into a while statement we can loop until a 0 is encountered and output the subtotal and then go back to the beginning of the loop (the outer loop), when two consecutive zeros are encountered, program exits out of the loop.
3. one loop: 1)simpler code (less complicated)
			 2)easier to debug
   two loops: 1) faster
   			  2) shorter/less code
