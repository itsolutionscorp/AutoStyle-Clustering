Which version did you implement for the exercise?
	We used a single loop.
Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
	In the second loop, you would count the zeros and continue until there are two zeros in a row. 
Which version do you prefer? Describe two reasons for preferring the one-loop version and two reasons for preferring the two-loop version.
	We prefer the single loop. It is easier to think about and it makes the code less complicated. 
	Two-loop: This helps keep the code more compact and is easier to read.
