- We implemented a single loop.

- In a double loop method, we would implement a while loop to control the scanning and a second while loop to control the conditions.

-We prefer the first method because the second while loop involves a simple condition which can be integrated easily into the first. Hence we have less brackets to take care of and more readibility.
