The version I implemented for this version only involves a single loop.

For the double loop version, the way it would work is have an inner loop for the subtotal that would reset everytime there was a zero entered.
Whenever there is another zero entered when the subtotal is zero, display the total and then exit.

The benefit of the single loop is that all subtotal and total can be handled simultaneously and it avoids nesting two loops together.
The double loop allows for only needing to handle the subtotal, making the exit case straightforward as it only depends on the subtotal
rather than having to check the last case and the current case.
