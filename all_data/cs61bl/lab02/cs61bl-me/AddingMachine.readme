Which version did you implement for the exercise?
We implemented the version with one while loop.

Describe in words how the other version would work, without actually coding it.
The other version would have nested while loops, the first for while (true), and the second for while (justStarted=true).


Which version do you prefer? Describe two reasons for preferring the one-loop version and two reasons for preferring the two-loop version.
We prefer the version with one loop because it seems easier to read/understand the hierarchy.
