Experiment 1:
We created two identical lists and tested each of the methods.
ArrayList was faster at finding/returning/changing an element at a specific index.
LinkedList was faster at adding a new element because there is no worst-case scenario.

Experiment 2:
Keeping next-ing through the list until hasNext returns false. Check the pointer of the current object's next to see if it points to the very first item in the list.
