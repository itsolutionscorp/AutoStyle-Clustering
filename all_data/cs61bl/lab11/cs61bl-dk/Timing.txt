Experiment 1


Testing the performance of removing items from the beggining of both type of lists. The ArrayList takes linear time while the LinkedList takes approximately constant time.
100000 element:
103616 (ArrayList)
65856 (LinkedList)
10000000 element:
5447553 (ArrayList)
77044 (LinkedList)


Experiment 2

Timing removeLast(); should be constant in the doubly linked list versus the time of a regular linkedlist will be linear. 

For 100000 element Linked list the time to removeLast() is 359274 nano seconds. And for 10000000 elements the time is 160559 nano seconds.
