We intialized an arraylist and a linkedlist, each with m number of integers between 1 and m.
for m = 1000, 10000, ..., 100000000
As a performance metric we called contains method on both to find the last element m,
and we got the following timings in msec for each m:

LinkedList times = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
ArrayList times  = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

We also tried contain for finding the middle elements (m/2) and found this:
LinkedList times = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
ArrayList times = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]

These show that the worse timing for LinkedList are better than the worse timing for
ArrayList. Additionally, they are both O(number of elements).
