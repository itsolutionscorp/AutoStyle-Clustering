Experiment 1:
Create a LinkedList and an ArrayList of 10000 random elements.
Time the addition, retrieval, and removal of elements
finding the item at a certain position is faster in an ArrayList
removing and adding items are faster in a LinkedList

Experiment 2:
Create a LinkedList and a List from lab of 10000 random elements
Time the removal of elements
removing items from a LinkedList is faster than in a List, because LinkedListis doubly linked
