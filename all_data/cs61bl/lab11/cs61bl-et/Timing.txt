first 
we setup the arraylist and the linklist very big. it need to be very big in order to make sure the timer worked.
1.test get(int index) method in both tinkliest and array list. we found that linklist is O(n) and arraylist is O(1)
2.test the delete method in both collection. we found that arrayList vary a lot fromO(n) to O(1).linkedlist is just O(1)
3.test the insert. linked list runs at O(1) and arrayList is O(n)

Second linkedList should have the ability to call previous node, so our experiment is to implement a linkedlist and make it implement the utterable class, but within the utterator class, we make sure that the next() does not stop when current.myNext==myHead so that the next() will never stop and have a recursive answer.
