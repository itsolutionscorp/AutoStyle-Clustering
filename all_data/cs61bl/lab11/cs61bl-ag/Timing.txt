Experiment 1:

We tested add(), contains(), and clear() methods on both ArrayList and LinkedList. We found that it took twice as long to add n=200000 objects to a LinkedList
as it did to add to an ArrayList, but it took the same amount of time for both to find a given object at the end of the collection and to clear all objects
from the collection.

Experiment 2:

We propose to implement a reverse iterator on a singly-linked list as implemented in previous labs, and then time its iteration compared to the reverseIterator() 
method in LinkedList. Because we have to make more assignment statements for our singly-linked list than a doubly-linked implementation would require,
we should be able to show that for large list sizes, the official LinkedList implementation is more efficient since it can reference Prev and Next 
variables rather than depending on assigning new temporary variables on each call to next().
