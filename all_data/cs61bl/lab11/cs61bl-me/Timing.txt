1: We used a test class to time a linked list and array over the insertion of 1000
and then 1000000 integers (all of them 1), and getting the value at the 500th and then 500000th elements.
the times are as follows:
Arraylist: ~8 ms to insert 1000 1s, ~0ms to get 500th element.
			~174 ms to insert 1000000 1s, ~0ms to get 500000th element.
Linked List: ~2ms to insert 1000 1s, ~1ms to get 500th element.
			~2204ms to insert 1000000 1s, ~15ms to get 500000th element.
			
2: For one, the java class supports a reverse iterator, which would be incredibly
inefficient to run without a tail variable on every ListNode. We used the iterator,
and it went through its values in roughly the same amount of time as the forward
iterator, ergo doubly linked list.
