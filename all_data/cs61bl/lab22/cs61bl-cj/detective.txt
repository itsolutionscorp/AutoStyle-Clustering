Beta: Insertion sort. In-oder and reverseOrder has really large difference in run time
Alpha: Selection sort. In-order and reverseOrder had about the same run time
Gamma: Quick sort. Short run time for large N. It's also much slower for reverse order. 
Delta: Merge sort. Also short run time for large N. The list order doesn't affer it's runtime.
Epsilon: Heap sort. There's zero runtime when the list is inOrder.
