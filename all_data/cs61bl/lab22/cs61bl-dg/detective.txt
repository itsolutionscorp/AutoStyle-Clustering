Alpha - Heap sort

The runtime for this algorithm is relatively constant, despite original list ordering. This is likely 
because of the fact that not many comparisons are needed to implement it.

Beta - Insertion Sort

For an ordered list, this algorithm doesn’t take long at all, but for a reversed order list, it takes 
a very long time. 

Gamma - Quick Sort

The runtime for this is long, despite whether the original list was relatively ordered or unordered.

Delta - Merge Sort

The runtime for this is relatively constant with respect to original list ordering, but the number of 
comparisons required is greater than that for other algorithms we’ve dealt with here, such as the 
heap sort.

Epsilon - Selection Sort

Despite the ordering of the original list, this algorithm takes a long time to complete.
