Alpha: Heap sort
		- takes approximately the same amount of time no matter what ordering the list has
		- takes fewer comparison than a merge sort for all ordering

Beta: Insertion sort
		- takes least time for an inorder list
		- takes longest time for an reverse order list

Gamma: Quick sort
		- takes siginificantly more time to sort an inorder list or a reverse ordered list

Delta: Merge sort
		- takes approximately the same amount of time no matter what ordering the list has
		- takes more comparison than a heap sort for all ordering

Epsilon: Selection sort
