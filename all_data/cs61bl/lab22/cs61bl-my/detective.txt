Alpha: Merge Sort. We calculated the most comparisons (worst case) that Merge sort could have and compared it to 32 (N)

Beta: Insertion Sort. We had an inorder list and beta made 32 comparisons, which is (N) and so we concluded it was beta.

Gamma: QuickSort. We put the list in reverse order and then doubled the elements in the list, and the growth skyrocketed.

Delta: Heap Sort. This was the last one standing.

Epsilon: Selection Sort. We calculated the exact amount of comparisons using n(n-1)/2 and it came out exact.
