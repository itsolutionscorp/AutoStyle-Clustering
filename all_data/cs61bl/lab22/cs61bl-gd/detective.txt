Corresponding relationship:
Alpha: Merge Sort Algorithm
Beta: Insertion Sort Algorithm
Gamma: Selection Sort Algorithm
Delta: Heap Sort Algorithm
Epsilon: Quicksort Algorithm

How do we determine it:
First of all we can determine that button Epsilon refers to the 
Quicksort algorithm. The reason is that Quicksort always does 
n*(n-1)/2 comparisons no matter what the order of the list is. 
Also Quicksort does not need to do any movements if the list is 
already inorder. This is what button Epsilon shows. 
Button Gamma refers to the selection sort algorithm, because when
 the list is inorder, selection sort algorithm only needs to do
  n-1 moves, which is what button gamma shows. 
Button Beta refers to insertion sort algorithm, because when the 
list is in order, it only needs to do n-1 comparisons. However, 
when the list is random, this algorithm would do a lot of comparisons 
and movements. This is what button Beta shows.
For the rest two buttons, button alpha refers to merge sort algorithm 
and button delta refers to heap sort algorithm. The reason is that
 when we do the heap sort algorithm, the total times of comparison
  will be greater than the times of movement, while the merge sort
   algorithm would have the opposite result. Since when we click button alpha,
    the number of comparison is less than the number of movements, alpha would 
    refers to merge sort algorithm. Therefore Delta would refer to heap sort algorithm.
