Alpha is heap sort. Both Alpha and Delta run fast in all situations, but Alpha uses many less comparisons.

Beta is insertion sort. Beta and Epsilon had the worst runtimes with larger lists, but Beta's runtime improved dramatically when the list was already sorted.

Gamma is quicksort. Gamma had a good runtime with larger lists except when the list was already in order or in reverse order.

Delta is merge sort. Delta runs fast in all situations and uses more comparisons than Alpha

Epsilon is selection sort. Epsilon had a bad runtime with larger lists and didn't improve when the list was already sorted.
