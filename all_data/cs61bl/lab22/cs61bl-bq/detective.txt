Beta is insertion sort 

Epsilon is selection sort

Alpha is merge sort

Gamma is quick sort 

Delta is heap sort


Gamma very slow for in Order and reverse order, but super fast for almost order and random

Gamma is quick sort - it works very quick except when the list is in order or in reverse order it is slow and can even cause a stack overflow exception to be thrown. This is because for those arrangements the pivot is either max or min and thus the code will run in O(n^2) time

Beta is very quick for in order, very slow for reverse order, pretty quick for almost order, slower for random

Beta is insertion sort

Epsilon moves nothing for in order, is very slow in everything

Epsilon is selection sort
Makes less movements than others, but is generally slow (in fact none for an already sorted list!)

Alpha is quick for all types of lists
makes much less comparisons than Delta — merge sort!

Delta - quick for everything
makes more comparisons — heap sort!
