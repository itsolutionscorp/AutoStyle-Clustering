Beta is insertion sort, because for small, sorted arrays, it takes roughly n comparisons. 

Epsilon is selection sort, because for small, sorted arrays, it takes rouhly n * (n-1) / 2 comparisons. 

Gamma is QuickSort, because for large, sorted arrays, it takes much longer than the other sorting algorithms like MergeSort and HeapSort. 

Alpha is MergeSort, because for small, sorted arrays, it takes n log n / 2 comparisons. 

Delta is HeapSort, because it is relatively quick with random and assorted large data.
