ALPHA : Merge Sort
Regardless of whether the list is in order or reverse, 
it does the same number of comparisons


BETA : Insertion Sort
If it is already sorted, it runs faster since it just adds 
the element to the end. If it is in reversed order, it takes a lot 
longer since it has to add the element to the front of the list.

GAMMA : Quick Sort
It has the fastest runtime.


DELTA: Heap Sort
Heap sort should be slightly faster for a reversed list since it doesnt have to 
bubble down elements when adding the element to the heap.



EPISILON : Selection Sort
It takes the exact number of moves for a list inorder and a list in reverse order. 
Selection sort finds the minimum and adds it to a new list, so it should make the 
same number of movements regardless of whether it is in inorder or in revers order.
