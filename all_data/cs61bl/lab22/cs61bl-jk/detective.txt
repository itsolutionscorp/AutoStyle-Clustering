# Sorting out the sorts cs61bl

 > Epsilon is selection sort: 
 	because for different lists, the comparisons are always n^2
 
 > Beta is Insertion sort: 
 	It's the second slowest and have n^2 comparason for reverse ordered lists, n comparason for inorder list
 	
 > Gamma is quick sort:
 	For inorder and Reverse order, this is very slow; but for average case, it's relatively fast. 
 	
 > Alpha is merge sort:
 	It need less comparison compared to heap sort..
 
 > Delta is heap sort: 
 	heap sort is like selection sort, so the run time for different lists are almost the same
