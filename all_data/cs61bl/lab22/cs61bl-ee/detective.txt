Epsilon - selection sort,  since no matter if the array is sorted or unsorted, the runtime doesnot change a lot.

Gamma - Quick sort,  since gamma does well in random array but especially bad in ordered and reverse ordered array.

Beta - Insertion sort, since Beta does especially well in ordered array, and when it comes to reverse ordered one, it doesnot work well.

Delta - Merge sort, no matter what kind the array is, it all does the best.

Alpha- Heap sort, since when it comes to random array, it is worse than Delta. We think it is probabaly because of the insertion need to bubble up all the time.
