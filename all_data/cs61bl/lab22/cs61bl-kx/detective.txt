write down which button corresponds to which sorting algorithm. For each, explain how you determined it.

Alpha- Heap
	Alpha made less comparisons in the best case scenario as opposed to delta and gamma. Alpha tended to 
	have more variety in total run time compared to Delta. Delta's run time was much more constant when it 
	came to randomly generated lists. Note that based on runtimes, it was clear that beta and episolon were the slowest two of the five, implying that 
	alpha gamma and delta were not of the selection/insertion variety.


Beta- Insertion
	Beta had the some of the slowest run time for best and worst case.
	When it came to best case however, it made exactly n comparisons, indicating that it was an insertion algorithm.


Gamma- Quick Sort
	Out of Alpha, Gamma, and Delta, Gamma had the slowest time for 
	worst case scenario. Quick Sort has worst case n^2



Delta- Merge
	Out of alpha and delta, merge made the most amount of comparisons in
	when the list was in order. It stays constant between in order and reverse order. Delta occasionally
	had large variance in run time when sorting random lists consecutively.


Epsilon- Selection
	Epsilon had the slowest run time for both best case
	and worst case. In addition, it made the same amount
	of comparisons for best and worse.
