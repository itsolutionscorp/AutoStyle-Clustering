\f0\fs24 \cf0 Alpha- merge sort because it the number of comparisons was never worst then n log(n).\
Beta- quick sort because when the number of elements was increased substantially the number of comparisons increased dramatically.\
Delta- heap sort because the number of movements is approximately equal to the number of comparisons. This is due to inputting all elements into a heap and then removing the elements.\
Gamma- selection sort because the number of comparison for a in order list and a reversed list was approximately the same.\
Epilson- insertion sort because when you started with a in ordered list there should be no movements.}
