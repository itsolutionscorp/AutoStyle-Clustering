Alpha : Heap sort because of process of elimination but also because it was similar to merge for all lists but took more timecd
Beta : Insertion sort because it has an n runtime when the list is already inOrder but makes the maximum number of comparisons for a reverse order list.
Delta : Merge sort because the time it took always ended up being N log N
Epsilon : Selection sort because it has the exact same number of comparisons regardless of how the list is arranged
Gamma : Quicksort because it had incredibly long runtimes for only inOrder and reverse order
