Alpha:
heap sort:
	acts as a heap array
	runtime for random is longer then normal. 

	
Beta:
	insertion sort:
	checking of the next is smaller or bigger then the first.
	runtime n in best case, n^2 in worst case
		we had n-1 comparisons for the experimental tests

Gamma:
	quick sort:
	picks the first and compares the rest of the element and sorts it
	runtime at worst is n, best case is log(n)


Delta:
	merge sort:
	splits the array in half into smaller pieces and merges them after sorting it
	runtime is nlog(n)

Epsilon:
	selection sort:
	going into each individual one and finding the smallest
	runtime would be n^2, n + (n-1) + (n-2) + .... + 1 comparisons
