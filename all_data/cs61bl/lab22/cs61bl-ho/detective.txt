Alpha: Selection Sort
Beta: Insertion Sort
Gamma:  Heap Sort
Delta: Merge Sort
Epsilon: Quick Sort


1. N = 32, Inorder: A: 80/320/0 B: 31/62/0 G: 558/31/0 D:231/304/0 E: 496/0/0

E made no movements, can only be Quick Sort
B made 31 comparison, therefore Beta is Insertion Sort
 
2. N = 32, ReverseOrder: A: 80/320/0 B: 496/558/1 G: 574/79/1 D: 202/270/0 E: 496/48/0

A made same movements, therefore Alpha is Selection Sort

Test B: for insertion sort, the reverse order takes far more time, correct

3. N = 7033, ReverseOrder: (Time)  G: 68 D: 5
    N = 7033, Random: (Time) G: 3 D: 3

It took G far more time to sort the reverse order, therefore, Gamma is Heap Sort.
On the contrary, it took D almost the same time to sort both of them, therefore, Delta is Merge Sort.
